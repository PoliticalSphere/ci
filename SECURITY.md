# Security Policy

Thank you for looking out for security issues in this project.

Please report potential security vulnerabilities responsibly using one of these options:

- Preferred: Open a private GitHub Security Advisory for this repository. This
  allows coordinated disclosure.

- If the Security Advisory workflow is not available, open a new **issue** and
  **prefix the title with `[SECURITY]`** (maintainers will triage privately).

When reporting, include:

- A short summary of the issue and the impact
- Detailed reproduction steps, minimal PoC, or test case
- Environment and version information
- Any attachments or logs that illustrate the problem

Response expectations

- We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days and provide a triage
  status.
- Critical issues will be prioritized for immediate mitigation; others will
  be scheduled and tracked as appropriate.

Disclosure policy

- We follow coordinated disclosure practices. Please allow time for mitigation
  before public disclosure.

Contact

- If you prefer email, please use the email on the repository profile or open a
  Security Advisory. Replace this line with a direct contact if you want a
  specific email: `security@<your-domain>`.

Thank you for helping us keep this project secure.
