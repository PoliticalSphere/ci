# ==============================================================================
# Political Sphere — Composite Action: Secret Scan (PR)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   Run a fast secret scan suitable for PR feedback.
#
# Metadata:
#   - Created: 2025-12-20
#   - Last updated: 2025-12-20
#
# Scope & Responsibilities:
#   - Does: execute the fast gitleaks scan in the current repo.
#   - Does NOT: scan full git history.
#
# Design Principles:
#   - Deterministic and non-interactive execution
#   - CI-safe with structured output
#   - Delegates to a single script for consistency
#
# Dependencies:
#   - ./.github/actions/ps-preflight
#   - ./.github/actions/ps-run
#   - tools/scripts/security/secret-scan-pr.sh
#   - gitleaks (runner-provided)
#
# Dependents:
#   - ./.github/workflows/pr-gates.yml
#
# Execution Model:
#   - Trigger: N/A (invoked by workflow steps)
#   - Type: composite action (internal-only)
#   - Invoked by: PR gates workflow
#
# Security & Policy Notes:
#   - Secrets: none
#   - Permissions: inherited from the caller (read-only expected)
#   - Constraints: CI requires gitleaks; local runs can be bootstrap-only
#
# Operational Notes:
#   - Timeouts: controlled by the calling job
#   - Artifacts: produced by the scan script (reports/**, logs/**)
#   - CI vs local: local scan may exit cleanly if gitleaks is missing
