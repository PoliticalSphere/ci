# ==============================================================================
# Political Sphere — Composite Action: Test (ps-task adapter)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   Run deterministic unit tests via PS Task Runner with standardized output.
#
# Notes:
#   - Thin adapter: delegates execution/logging/reporting to ps-run.
#   - Exposes minimal knobs (script/workdir/coverage expectations).
