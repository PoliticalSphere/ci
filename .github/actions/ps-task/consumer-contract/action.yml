# Political Sphere - Composite Action: Consumer Contract
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   Validate consumer repositories against the platform contract policy.
#
# Metadata:
#   - id: consumer-contract
#   - version: 1.0.0
#   - owner: political-sphere
#   - classification: internal
#   - Created: 2025-12-20
#   - Last updated: 2025-12-20
# Scope & Responsibilities:
#   - Does: run contract checks and emit reports/logs.
#   - Does NOT: install dependencies or alter permissions.
#
# Design Principles:
#   - Deterministic and non-interactive execution
#   - Policy-driven and AI-readable output
#   - CI-safe with explicit inputs
#
# Dependencies:
#   - ./.github/actions/ps-task/ps-run
#   - tools/scripts/consumer/contract-check.sh
#   - configs/consumer/contract.json
#   - configs/consumer/exceptions.json
#
# Dependents:
#   - ./.github/workflows/consumer-contract.yml
#
# Execution Model:
#   - Trigger: N/A (invoked by workflow steps)
#   - Type: composite action (internal-only)
#
# Security & Policy Notes:
#   - Secrets: none
#   - Permissions: inherited from the caller (read-only expected)
#
# Operational Notes:
#   - Timeouts: controlled by the calling job
#   - Artifacts: reports/** and logs/** emitted by the script
