# ==============================================================================
# Political Sphere — Composite Action: Setup (Runner + Node)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   Combine runner hardening and Node.js setup into a single step.
#
# Metadata:
#   - Created: 2025-12-20
#   - Last updated: 2025-12-20
#
# Scope & Responsibilities:
#   - Does: harden the runner, checkout code, setup Node.js, optionally install deps.
#   - Does NOT: run build/test scripts or change job permissions.
#
# Design Principles:
#   - Deterministic and non-interactive execution
#   - Explicit inputs with safe defaults
#   - SHA-pinned actions only
#
# Dependencies:
#   - ./.github/actions/ps-harden-runner
#   - ./.github/actions/ps-node-setup
#
# Dependents:
#   - (Optional) workflows that want a single setup step
#
# Execution Model:
#   - Trigger: N/A (invoked by workflow steps)
#   - Type: composite action (internal-only)
#
# Security & Policy Notes:
#   - Secrets: optional NODE_AUTH_TOKEN is inherited from the caller
#   - Permissions: inherited from the caller
#
# Operational Notes:
#   - Timeouts: controlled by the calling job
#   - Artifacts: none
