# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:

#
# Metadata:
#   - Created: 2025-12-20
#   - Last updated: 2025-12-20
#
# Scope & Responsibilities:
#   - Does: print the banner from the platform repository.
#   - Does NOT: modify files, environment variables, or permissions.
#
# Design Principles:
#   - Deterministic output
#   - Non-interactive execution
#   - CI-safe behavior
#
# Dependencies:
#   - tools/scripts/branding/print-banner.sh
#   - branding/ps-banner.txt
#
# Dependents:
#   - ./.github/actions/ps-run
#   - ./.github/actions/ci-validate
#
# Execution Model:
#   - Trigger: N/A (invoked by workflow steps)
#   - Type: composite action (internal-only)
#   - Invoked by: workflows and other composite actions
#
# Security & Policy Notes:
#   - Secrets: none
#   - Permissions: inherited from caller (no writes)
#   - Constraints: inline bash is required to resolve paths
#
# Operational Notes:
#   - Timeouts: controlled by the calling job
#   - Artifacts: none
#   - CI vs local: identical behavior
