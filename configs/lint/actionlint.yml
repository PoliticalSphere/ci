# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   Baseline configuration for validating GitHub Actions workflows with actionlint.
#
# Policy:
#   - Default deny for self-hosted runner labels (none allowed unless listed).
#   - If self-hosted runners are introduced:
#       * explicitly list labels here
#       * document a risk decision
