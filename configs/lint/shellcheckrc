# ==============================================================================
# Political Sphere — ShellCheck Configuration (.shellcheckrc)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   Enforce safe, portable shell scripting defaults for the CI/CD platform.

# Meta:
#   Version: 1.0.0

# Governance:
#   - No global suppressions without an explicit, documented rationale.
#   - Prefer fixing scripts over disabling checks.
#   - If suppression is required, it must be local and justified:
#       shellcheck disable=SCxxxx  # rationale
# ==============================================================================

# Treat undefined variables strictly; prefer deterministic scripts.
# (ShellCheck itself is a linter; strictness is enforced by failing CI on findings.)

# Follow `source` statements only within the repository (reduces noise and risk).
# Adjust if you vendor shared libraries elsewhere.
# NOTE: external-sources flag is intentionally disabled in config; if you need to
# follow external sources, enable it via command-line during local runs.
#
# CI behaviour: the platform CLI runner invokes shellcheck with --external-sources
# (-x) to resolve sourced helper files so linting is more precise in CI.

# Do not follow arbitrary paths from outside the repo.
# (ShellCheck uses this mainly to find sourced files; keep it conservative.)
source-path=.

# Default shell dialect.
# Use bash as the platform default. If a script is POSIX sh, it should specify
# #!/bin/sh and be checked separately if desired.
shell=bash

# Optional: specify severity threshold only if you intend to allow lower levels.
# For PS, prefer failing on all findings (handled by CI), so keep this unset.
# --severity=style
