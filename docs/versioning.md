# Versioning Strategy

This repository uses Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for all released assets:
reusable workflows, composite actions, scripts, and configuration bundles.

## Goals

- Make upgrades predictable and reversible.
- Preserve compatibility for consuming repositories.
- Provide clear signals for security or breaking changes.

## Versioning Rules

- **MAJOR**: breaking change to any public interface.
  - Examples: workflow input changes, action interface changes,
    removal of configs, stricter validation that breaks consumers.
- **MINOR**: backwards-compatible additions.
  - Examples: new workflows, new actions, new optional inputs,
    additional checks that are non-breaking.
- **PATCH**: backwards-compatible fixes and improvements.
  - Examples: bug fixes, doc fixes, logging improvements,
    configuration tuning that does not break defaults.

## What Is Considered Public

- Reusable workflows in `/.github/workflows`.
- Composite actions in `/.github/actions`.
- Configs and policy files in `/configs`.
- CLI scripts in `/tools/scripts` intended for consumers.
- Example templates in `/examples`.

## Release Process

1. Changes are grouped under `CHANGELOG.md` with an `[Unreleased]` section.
2. A release is cut by moving entries into a new version section.
3. Tags follow `vX.Y.Z`.
4. Release artifacts are generated by a `release.yml` workflow.

## Support Windows

- The two most recent minor versions are supported for security fixes.
- Security patches may be backported to supported minors.

## Risk Decisions

Any deviations from these rules must be documented in
`docs/risk-decisions.md` with the rationale and approval record.
