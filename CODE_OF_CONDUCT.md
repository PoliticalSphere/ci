# Code of Conduct

This project follows a simple Code of Conduct to foster an open and respectful
community.

Standards

- Be respectful and kind in interactions.
- No harassment, discrimination, or abusive language.
- Keep discussions focused on technical matters; avoid personal attacks.

Reporting

- To report abusive behavior, open an issue (prefixed with `[conduct]`) or
  use the contact details in this repo's profile.

Enforcement

- Reports will be triaged and addressed promptly. Violations may result in
  removal of content or exclusion from the repository at the maintainer's
  discretion.

If you'd like a more formal or detailed Code of Conduct (e.g., Contributor
Covenant), say the word and I will add it.
